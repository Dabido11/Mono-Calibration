# ConceptUI
An official sub-modifier which can be used anytime to replace the default Text UI. More commits, issues and pull requests are to be
expected in the future.

## What is ConceptUI?
Concept UI, as of now, is a set of pictures to modify the game in specific ways. It will only focus on the smallest and important details
that can be found in the game. You can find examples of this is in the latest commits!

## Who is the main developer for ConceptUI?
GameTamer (Neritox) is the new lead developer in this project. I have passed on the ownership to him and I will be helping him instead
of developing it myself.

## What's the difference between Text UI and ConceptUI?
Concept UI is more personalised and adds more pictures and imagery towards it. Text UI is the default
setting and is not focused on the more specific details.
