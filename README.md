# Mono-Calibration
A worked on project developed by a small group or organisation.
This is the official GitHub and all members that review and moderate this GitHub are part of
the moderation or development team.

## Notes
We are not a great and big community, we are just a group having fun and using our
imagination to some sort and not leaving it to waste.

AKA, we're not serious, just having a bit of fun.

## Releases and Publishing Work
We will publish the concepts by mid-winter or late-spring. These are Australian seasons,
don't forget! You can find our current releases from v0.1 (beta) all the way to present.

## Will this stay as a concept?
Yes, until we get programmers and artists for it.
